    <h2>K-Pop Companies</h2>
    <p>K-pop companies play a pivotal role in the creation and success of K-pop artists and groups. These entertainment companies, such as SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, and HYBE Corporation (formerly Big Hit Entertainment), serve as talent incubators, providing rigorous training and management to aspiring artists. They scout, train, and groom individuals or groups, guiding them through vocal and dance lessons, image development, and overall artist development. K-pop companies also oversee the production of music, music videos, and promotional activities for their artists. Beyond their influence on the careers of K-pop stars, these companies contribute significantly to the K-pop industry's global reach. Their strategic marketing, investment in cutting-edge production, and ability to foster talent have propelled K-pop to international stardom, making them integral players in the global music landscape.</p>
