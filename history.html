            <h2>History of K-Pop</h2>
            <p>The history of K-pop, short for Korean pop music, is a captivating journey that spans several decades and has evolved into a global phenomenon. K-pop's roots can be traced back to the early 1950s, with the emergence of popular Korean folk and trot music. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that K-pop as we know it today began to take shape. One pivotal moment came with the debut of Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992, a group that fused Western music genres like rap and rock with traditional Korean elements, effectively pioneering the modern K-pop sound. In the early 2000s, idol groups like H.O.T, S.E.S, and Shinhwa paved the way for K-pop's first wave of international recognition. The genre continued to evolve and diversify, reaching a global audience in the 2010s with the advent of social media and platforms like YouTube. Icons like BTS, BLACKPINK, and EXO led the charge, achieving unprecedented worldwide success and solidifying K-pop's status as a cultural force transcending borders and languages. Today, K-pop remains a vibrant and ever-evolving genre, celebrated for its catchy music, breathtaking performances, and the deep connection it fosters between artists and fans worldwide.</p>
